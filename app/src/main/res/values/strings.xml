    <string name="summary">The Meyer lemon (Citrus meyeri) is an amazing plant species known for its flavor and ease of growing. It is a hybrid between a mandarin orange and a lemon, lending itself to a sweet flavor and slightly tarter taste than either of its parent fruits. Unlike other varieties of lemon, the Meyer has a slightly thinner peel and can be grown easily from seed or even from cuttings from an existing plant. </string>

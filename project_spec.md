## App Overview

### Description 

**üå±AgroVisionüó∫Ô∏è is a gardening app that provides the user with location specific regional climate & USDA hardiness zone information which is used to get food plant gardening options (vegetables, herbs, fruits), growth care information, etc.**

### App Evaluation

<!-- Evaluation of your app across the following attributes -->

- **Category:** 
- **Mobile:** The purpose of mobile apps has always been convenience for the user--the ease of having all the information you will ever need literally at the tip of your fingers. We want this app to be our gardeners mobile hub for all information related to their future food forest.
- **Story:** One of our goals when developing this app will be to place emphasis on creating a user-friendly experience, in which a new aspiring gardener can easily take control of their diet from their backyard or balcony garden will be able to easily get started. 
- **Market:** The intended audience for this app is not meant to be extremely niche, and only directed for people who are existing gardeners, farmers, botanists, and other related professionals. The focus of this app is regular food gardening that anyone can start in their home, which means the market is specific but not too narrow.
- **Habit:** The aim of this app is certainly not be to indefinitely latch onto the users' attention but rather for quick access to gardening information and record keeping purposes.
- **Scope:** The scope for this app is still in the process of being developed and it has definitely been narrowed down greatly since the conception of our idea, yet it still remains an exciting idea that we are looking forward to bringing to life. Because of the potential usage of 3 APIs that may or may not be well-documented simultaneously and our beginner level experience with Kotlin app development, this app is likely to be technically challenging even with an extremely stripped down version of the app. We will continue to adjust our objectives as we go but we have a clearly defined overarching objective for location-specific food gardening information.
